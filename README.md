<h1>Predict a Video Game’s Global Sales Using Machine Learning</h1>

YouTube Demonstration (WIP)

<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Problem Summary</h3>
KaitoIma Gaming, a large video game company based in North America, has recently released a new game called "KAITO,” which has achieved exceptional success in the gaming industry. Because of this achievement, the organization is considering expanding its market presence to gamers all over the world. Although the company normally focuses on the NA market, the potential for growth through expansion of customers has piqued the interest of KaitoIma Gaming. To make an informed decision, the company proposes leveraging data from previous game releases to create an application to evaluate the feasibility and potential return on investment of this expansion. This tool will utilize machine learning and will meet the company’s needs by predicting the global sales of a game based on its features.
<h3>Application Benefits</h3>
This machine learning-driven solution will enhance decision making across the company, giving a rough estimate of which markets to target and which characteristics of a game will resonate with gamers on a worldwide scale. A semi-accurate prediction of a game’s global sales will help the company in curating what the best genre, platform, and publisher to use in order to maximize the customer outreach and profits. Additionally, this information will grant a competitive edge to the company as it aids in solidifying their position in the industry.
<h3>Application Description</h3>
This application will be standalone and written in the programming language Python because of its ease of compatibility with libraries that will be used for machine learning calculations and graphs. The development environment will be through a web-based environment called Jupyter Notebook, and that will be used for a distribution for scientific computing called Anaconda. Using existing historical data from existing games, the data will be used to train a Linear Regression machine learning model in order for the application to predict the number of global sales. Additionally, charts and graphs will be used to visualize the relationships between data variables.
