<h3>Accuracy</h3>
<hr>
<p>A scatter plot was utilized to visually represent the precision of the predictive model. By plotting the predicted global sales against the actual global sales, the efficacy of the model could be readily evaluated and subsequently refined. The proximity of the data points to the dotted red line serves as a measure of data accuracy. The model consistently demonstrates close alignment with the line, indicating its reliability as a dependable source of information.</p>

<h3>Platform Distribution</h3>
<hr>
<p>The significance of each platform in the context of global sales and its popularity were comprehensively analyzed by means of a pie chart. This visual representation enabled us to identify platforms with substantial user bases and potential high market demand. Through this analysis, valuable insights were obtained regarding the platforms that hold significant potential for business growth. </p>

<h3>Genre Distribution</h3>
<hr>
<p> In order to analyze the distribution of genres and global sales within the dataset, a bar graph was employed. This visual representation allowed for the identification of genres with the highest and lowest sales figures by examining the heights of the bars. The insights gained from this analysis played a crucial role in guiding the decision-making process for selecting genres with the most potential for global market expansion.

The analysis revealed that certain genres, despite having a larger number of games, did not perform as well in terms of global sales. For instance, while the adventure genre exhibited a higher number of games compared to the platform genre, the latter demonstrated significantly stronger performance in terms of international sales. These findings highlight the importance of considering global sales figures rather than solely relying on the popularity of genres when making strategic decisions for global market expansion.</p>
